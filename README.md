# FLX Script
FLX Script (flɪks skrɪpt), is a program designed to help organize the proccess of createing shortfilms.

## Backstory
This was a project I made late Sophmore year of high school. I put it here just to keep a record. I would not reccomend running this code or using this software for anything important. In addition to it being made in PHP, it uses a lot of unfiltered sql inputs.
